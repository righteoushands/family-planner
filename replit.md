# Sancta Familia — Family Management & Homeschooling Dashboard

## Overview
A Python HTTP server (no framework) running on port 5000. A Catholic family dashboard for the McAdams family: Lauren (Mom), John (Dad), JP (14), Joseph (12), Michael (5), James (13 months). Features Mass readings, weather, meal plans, calendar, chores, and a five-companion AI ecosystem: Lucy (Catholic friend/integrator), Lorenzo (personal chef), Father Gregory (academic headmaster), Coach (family fitness), Dr. Monica (child development + pediatric health). Full authentication with per-user access control.

## Family Quest App (GDD v2 — Full RPG Overhaul)
Lives in `family_quest/` directory, served at `/quest/*` by the main app via `fq_bridge.py`.

- **Bridge**: `family_quest/fq_bridge.py` — imported by the main app; routes `/quest/*` GET/POST into FQ
- **Adapter**: `family_quest/fq_api.py` — the ONLY file in FQ that imports from the main app (auth, daily schedule). All other FQ modules call through this adapter.
- **Auth**: `fq_auth.py` delegates to `fq_api` (no direct parent imports)
- **Data files**: `family_quest/data/` — `quests.json`, `xp.json` (real_coins+game_coins+resources), `rewards.json`, `streaks.json`, `redemptions.json`, `heroes.json`, `boss_progress.json`, `fortress.json`, `equipment.json`, `inventory.json`, `mines.json`, `boss_settings.json`
- **Modules**: `fq_data.py` (all data/engine logic), `fq_render.py` (HTML shell), `fq_views_parent.py` (parent views), `fq_views_child.py` (child board)
- **Quest types**: daily, side, boss, event; each with energy_value+real_coin_value+game_coin_value rewards, assigned children, date, optional item_reward
- **Sessions**: Separate cookie `fq_session` (Path=/quest) so it doesn't conflict with main app session
- **Separation rule**: No FQ module (except `fq_api.py` and `fq_bridge.py`) may import from the parent directory

### GDD v2 Core Design
- **Dual currency**: 🪙 Real Coins (from quests → spend at real reward store, mom approves) + 💰 Game Coins (from quests/bosses → spend in-game on fortress/items)
- **Energy (⚡)**: Replaces stamina; earned by completing quests; spent attacking bosses (hits_per_turn per attack)
- **Resources**: 💎 Crystals, 💠 Diamonds, 🟤 Copper, ⚙️ Iron — from mines; used for equipment upgrades
- **Heroes (6)**: Link (starter), Zelda (boss #5 unlock), Ganondorf (#15), Samus (#25), Mario (#40), Fox (#60); each with damage/defense/HP stats and form evolution at Level 50; tracked per-child in heroes.json
  - Form 1 = 3 hits/turn; Form 2 (post-evolution) = 9 hits/turn; costs Copper+GC+Crystals+Diamonds+Iron
- **Sequential bosses**: Boss N has N×500 HP; rewards N×10 GC + N×10 RC + N×50 hero XP; tracked per-child in boss_progress.json; total defeated unlocks new heroes
- **Big Bosses**: Special named bosses (Ganon, Ridley, Bowser, Andross, Wolf) with huge HP and rewards; also unlock heroes; tracked in boss_progress.json
- **Fortress**: 10 levels (Watchtower→Royal Citadel); passive GC income 10→100/day; upgrade costs GC; tracked in fortress.json
- **Mine runs**: 5 types — Gold (→RC), Crystal (→Crystals), Diamond (→Diamonds), Copper (→Copper), Iron (→Iron); each has base_rate/min and target duration; cave-in at 2× target for Gold, 3× for others; consolation prizes on cave-in
- **Equipment**: Sword (5 levels, Crystals cost), Shield (5 levels, Diamonds), Armor (5 levels, Diamonds), Ring (5 levels, Copper/Iron); modify hero damage/defense
- **Single-use items**: Battle Axe (1.5× boss damage), Hammer (1.5× mine yield); awarded by parents via boss-settings/award-item or via quest item_reward

### Child Board UI (6 Zone Tabs)
1. **⚔️ Bosses** — current sequential boss HP bar, attack button (costs energy), rewards preview
2. **👹 Big Boss** — named milestone bosses with hero unlock rewards
3. **🏰 Fortress** — level/income display, collect daily income, upgrade button
4. **⛏️ Mines** — start/collect mine runs; active mine timer with cave-in countdown
5. **🎒 Equipment** — slot levels with upgrade buttons showing resource costs
6. **🛒 Store** — spend Real Coins on parent-configured real-world rewards (mom approval required)

### Key API Routes (GDD v2)
- `POST /quest/api/complete-quest` — `{quest_id, child}` → returns energy/rc/gc earned + all balances
- `POST /quest/api/attack-boss` — `{child, use_battle_axe}` → sequential boss attack
- `POST /quest/api/attack-big-boss` — `{child, big_boss_id, use_battle_axe}`
- `POST /quest/api/collect-fortress` — `{child}` → daily passive GC income
- `POST /quest/api/upgrade-fortress` — `{child}` → spends GC to upgrade fortress level
- `POST /quest/api/set-hero` — `{child, hero}` → switch active hero
- `POST /quest/api/evolve-hero` — `{child}` → consume resources for Form 2 evolution
- `POST /quest/api/upgrade-equipment` — `{child, slot}`
- `POST /quest/api/start-mine` — `{child, mine_type, use_hammer}`
- `POST /quest/api/collect-mine` — `{child, mine_id}`
- `POST /quest/api/redeem-reward` — `{child, reward_id}` → creates pending redemption (Real Coins)
- `POST /quest/api/award-currency` — `{child, field, amount, label}` (parent only)
- `GET/POST /quest/boss-settings` — parent item-award page
- `POST /quest/boss-settings/award-item` — directly awards item to child(ren)

## Schedule / FROL Architecture
- **FROL (Family Rule of Life)** = `data/day_templates/{Weekday}.json` — the ONE source of truth for all schedule data.
  - Format: `{"weekday": "Tuesday", "grid": {"Mom": {"9:00 AM": "Morning Prayer", ...}, "JP": {...}, ...}}`
  - `data_helpers.get_frol_day_slots(weekday, person)` → `{time: label}` dict for any person/day
  - `data/family_schedule.json` has been **deleted**; all code now reads from day templates only
- **Exercise assignments**: `data/exercise_assignments.json` — `{weekday: {person: assignment_text}}`
  - `data_helpers.load_exercise_assignments()` / `save_exercise_assignments()`
- **Settings schedule grid** (`/settings#s-systems`): reads Mom's column from all 7 day templates; saves via `/rol-cell-save` (single cell) or `/settings-schedule-save` (full form) → both write directly to the day template
- **`/family-schedule` GET route**: 302 redirects to `/settings#s-systems`

## Architecture
- **Entry point**: `app.py` — single HTTP handler routing all GET/POST requests
- **Rendering**: each feature area has a `render_*.py` module returning HTML strings
- **Data**: `data/` directory — JSON files for settings, schedule, progress, meals, calendar cache
- **Port**: 5000 (`PORT=5000 python app.py`)
- **Timezone**: Eastern (`America/New_York`), helpers in `render_schedule_support.py`
- **Auth**: `auth.py` — session-based, PIN login, per-user access tables, viewer context
- **Live task snapshot**: `daily_schedule_engine.boys_task_snapshot(iso)` and `boys_task_snapshot_text(iso)` return real-time task state (done/pending) for all four boys; injected into Lucy's system prompt on every message; also available at `GET /api/boys-tasks?date=YYYY-MM-DD`

## Authentication System
- **`auth.py`**: Session store (in-memory), PIN management (`data/auth/pins.json`), access control tables
- **`render_login.py`**: Login page — avatar grid (all 6 members) + PIN pad modal
- **Login rules**: Lauren/John/JP/Joseph → 4-digit PIN (default `0000`); Michael/James → tap avatar (no PIN)
- **Sessions**: Browser-close sessions (no max-age cookie). `set_viewer()`/`get_viewer()` for single-threaded context
- **Child access** — JP & Joseph: home `/`, `/today`, `/week`, `/schedule/{own}`, `/meals`, `/recipes`, `/chores`, `/prayer` (read-only); can POST to `/toggle-task` and `/message-mom`
- **Michael**: Same but no `/recipes`; own schedule page only
- **Admins** (Lauren/John): Full access to everything
- **Message Mom**: Children send messages via modal (any page); Lauren sees inbox on home dashboard with unread count badge in nav
- **PIN management**: Settings page → "Login PINs" section (admin only); `/save-pins` POST route

## Key Features
- **`/today`**: Compact child dash cards (`render_child_dash_card`) — carryover always visible, first unchecked task auto-advances on check; progress bar; "Full list →" link; "Now: X" strip with link to `/now`
- **`/now`**: Family activity view — each member's current slot, next slot, first unchecked task, progress bar; links to each member's detail page
- **`/schedule/{child}`**: Full child schedule with all tasks
- **`/settings`**: Accordion sections (App, AI/Planning, Cycle, Household, Integrations)
  - Quick-jump pill nav (⚙ App | 🤖 AI | 🌙 Cycle | 🏠 Household | 📅 Calendars)
  - Up/down arrows for section reordering (localStorage-persisted)
  - "What Lucy Knows" summary card at top of AI section (green chips per field)
- **Lucy AI**: `/lucy` — Claude Haiku chat with **persistent conversation history** saved to `data/lucy_history.json` (up to 60 messages / 30 turns). History pre-rendered on page load; "New conversation" button clears via `/lucy-clear-history`. `[RULE:add]...[/RULE]` tags trigger Save button; rules stored in `family_constraints.lucy_rules`
- **Lucy history**: `load_lucy_history()` / `append_lucy_messages()` / `clear_lucy_history()` in `data_helpers.py`. Server history (last 30 msgs) sent to Claude — client no longer needs to send history
- **Lucy web fetch**: `web_fetch.py` — when Mom includes a URL in her message, the server fetches the page, strips it to plain text (up to 5 000 chars), and injects it into Lucy's system prompt context before calling Claude. No extra UI needed — just paste the link
- **Calendar**: 150 events from 6 calendars (`data/subscribed_calendar_cache.json`), 15-day lookahead

## Day List (Core Feature)
The Day List is the primary per-person view — a complete chronological schedule for each person built directly from the Rule of Life templates in `data/day_templates/`.

- **Engine**: `build_day_list(child, weekday, iso)` in `daily_schedule_engine.py` — reads the Rule of Life grid, merges same-label slots, classifies each by kind (prayer/meal/school/chore/exercise/routine/free/task), expands variable slots with real data (school assignments from PDF engine, chores from `data/chores.json`, manual tasks + carryover)
- **Stats**: `day_list_stats(day_list)` → `{total, done, pct}`
- **Day List renderer**: `_render_day_list_html()` in `render_schedule.py` — generates the interactive chronological HTML with color-coded kind indicators and expandable sub-items
- **Print**: `render_print_child_day_list(child, date)` → clean print-ready version; route: `GET /print/day/{child}?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Kind colors**: prayer=#c8a42a, mass=#4a1a6e, meal=#8b3a5c, exercise=#1a6e3e, school=#1e3566, chore=#8b3a1a, task=#5b3a8a
- **Templates**: `data/day_templates/{Weekday}.json` — grid per person; falls back to `Friday.json`

## AI / API
- Claude model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- API key stored: `data/app_settings.json` → `family_constraints.anthropic_api_key`
- Lucy context builder: `build_lucy_context()` in `render_lucy.py`

## Data Files
- `data/app_settings.json` — all settings including `family_constraints` dict
- `data/progress.json` — task completion state (task_id → bool)
- `data/family_schedule.json` — weekly schedule grid (days × time slots)
- `data/subscribed_calendar_cache.json` — 150 merged calendar events

## Navigation
- Mobile nav: `position:fixed; bottom:0; height:64px; z-index:2000` (ui_helpers.py)
- iOS input bar fix: `position:fixed; bottom:64px` for chat input

## Active Integrations
- **Google Drive**: Connected via Replit connector (`connection:conn_google-drive_01KNHERVT8AX027AZFJWRZ4H93`). Uses `@replit/connectors-sdk` (Node.js) via `gdrive_helper.js` + Python wrapper `gdrive.py`. School page has a Drive file browser at `/gdrive-files` (GET, admin only). Files are browsable and PDFs/Google Docs import directly. To refresh auth if token expires: call `proposeIntegration("connection:conn_google-drive_01KNHERVT8AX027AZFJWRZ4H93")` then restart.

## Pending Integrations
- **Notion** (`connector:ccfg_notion_01K49R392Z3CSNMXCPWSV67AF4`): User expressed interest in connecting Notion to improve relational data management (linking recipes to meal plans, managing roadmap/recipe book with better UI). OAuth was dismissed — when Lauren is ready to proceed, call `proposeIntegration("connector:ccfg_notion_01K49R392Z3CSNMXCPWSV67AF4")` to restart the OAuth flow, then `addIntegration` once it becomes a connection. Planned use cases: recipe ↔ meal plan linking, roadmap board, family history/memory book archival.

## Standing Rules (Lauren's Preferences)
These apply automatically to every new feature built — no need to ask each time.

### Auto-Save Everything
Whenever a new feature includes any form, text input, textarea, or multi-step workflow, it MUST include draft persistence. Lauren is a mom with young children and gets interrupted constantly — work in progress must never be silently lost.

**Implementation pattern:**
- Save to `localStorage` on every `oninput` or `onchange` event
- Use a descriptive, versioned key (e.g. `featureName_draft_v1`)
- Auto-restore on page load — pre-fill fields and re-open the form/panel if a draft exists
- Show a subtle green "Your draft was restored" notice when a draft is loaded
- Clear the draft **only** on explicit success: successful server save, submit, or deliberate "Start Over" / "Cancel" click
- Expire drafts older than 24 hours
- Prefer server-side auto-save (fetch POST on change) over localStorage when a server endpoint already exists for that data; only use localStorage when there is no immediate server save
- For multi-step AI workflows (like Plan Importer), persist the full result JSON + original input so the user can return to the results phase after any interruption
