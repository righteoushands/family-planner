# Sancta Familia — Family Management & Homeschooling Dashboard

## Overview
A Python HTTP server (no framework) running on port 5000. A Catholic family dashboard for the McAdams family: Lauren (Mom), John (Dad), JP (14), Joseph (12), Michael (5), James (13 months). Features Mass readings, weather, meal plans, calendar, chores, and a five-companion AI ecosystem: Lucy (Catholic friend/integrator), Lorenzo (personal chef), Father Gregory (academic headmaster), Coach (family fitness), Dr. Monica (child development + pediatric health). Full authentication with per-user access control.

## Architecture
- **Entry point**: `app.py` — single HTTP handler routing all GET/POST requests
- **Rendering**: each feature area has a `render_*.py` module returning HTML strings
- **Data**: `data/` directory — JSON files for settings, schedule, progress, meals, calendar cache
- **Port**: 5000 (`PORT=5000 python app.py`)
- **Timezone**: Eastern (`America/New_York`), helpers in `render_schedule_support.py`
- **Auth**: `auth.py` — session-based, PIN login, per-user access tables, viewer context

## Authentication System
- **`auth.py`**: Session store (in-memory), PIN management (`data/auth/pins.json`), access control tables
- **`render_login.py`**: Login page — avatar grid (all 6 members) + PIN pad modal
- **Login rules**: Lauren/John/JP/Joseph → 4-digit PIN (default `0000`); Michael/James → tap avatar (no PIN)
- **Sessions**: Browser-close sessions (no max-age cookie). `set_viewer()`/`get_viewer()` for single-threaded context
- **Child access** — JP & Joseph: home `/`, `/today`, `/week`, `/schedule/{own}`, `/meals`, `/recipes`, `/chores`, `/prayer` (read-only); can POST to `/toggle-task` and `/message-mom`
- **Michael**: Same but no `/recipes`; own schedule page only
- **Admins** (Lauren/John): Full access to everything
- **Message Mom**: Children send messages via modal (any page); Lauren sees inbox on home dashboard with unread count badge in nav
- **PIN management**: Settings page → "Login PINs" section (admin only); `/save-pins` POST route

## Key Features
- **`/today`**: Compact child dash cards (`render_child_dash_card`) — carryover always visible, first unchecked task auto-advances on check; progress bar; "Full list →" link; "Now: X" strip with link to `/now`
- **`/now`**: Family activity view — each member's current slot, next slot, first unchecked task, progress bar; links to each member's detail page
- **`/schedule/{child}`**: Full child schedule with all tasks
- **`/settings`**: Accordion sections (App, AI/Planning, Cycle, Household, Integrations)
  - Quick-jump pill nav (⚙ App | 🤖 AI | 🌙 Cycle | 🏠 Household | 📅 Calendars)
  - Up/down arrows for section reordering (localStorage-persisted)
  - "What Lucy Knows" summary card at top of AI section (green chips per field)
- **Lucy AI**: `/lucy` — Claude Haiku chat with **persistent conversation history** saved to `data/lucy_history.json` (up to 60 messages / 30 turns). History pre-rendered on page load; "New conversation" button clears via `/lucy-clear-history`. `[RULE:add]...[/RULE]` tags trigger Save button; rules stored in `family_constraints.lucy_rules`
- **Lucy history**: `load_lucy_history()` / `append_lucy_messages()` / `clear_lucy_history()` in `data_helpers.py`. Server history (last 30 msgs) sent to Claude — client no longer needs to send history
- **Lucy web fetch**: `web_fetch.py` — when Mom includes a URL in her message, the server fetches the page, strips it to plain text (up to 5 000 chars), and injects it into Lucy's system prompt context before calling Claude. No extra UI needed — just paste the link
- **Calendar**: 150 events from 6 calendars (`data/subscribed_calendar_cache.json`), 15-day lookahead

## AI / API
- Claude model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- API key stored: `data/app_settings.json` → `family_constraints.anthropic_api_key`
- Lucy context builder: `build_lucy_context()` in `render_lucy.py`

## Data Files
- `data/app_settings.json` — all settings including `family_constraints` dict
- `data/progress.json` — task completion state (task_id → bool)
- `data/family_schedule.json` — weekly schedule grid (days × time slots)
- `data/subscribed_calendar_cache.json` — 150 merged calendar events

## Navigation
- Mobile nav: `position:fixed; bottom:0; height:64px; z-index:2000` (ui_helpers.py)
- iOS input bar fix: `position:fixed; bottom:64px` for chat input

## Active Integrations
- **Google Drive**: Connected via Replit connector (`connection:conn_google-drive_01KNHERVT8AX027AZFJWRZ4H93`). Uses `@replit/connectors-sdk` (Node.js) via `gdrive_helper.js` + Python wrapper `gdrive.py`. School page has a Drive file browser at `/gdrive-files` (GET, admin only). Files are browsable and PDFs/Google Docs import directly. To refresh auth if token expires: call `proposeIntegration("connection:conn_google-drive_01KNHERVT8AX027AZFJWRZ4H93")` then restart.

## Standing Rules (Lauren's Preferences)
These apply automatically to every new feature built — no need to ask each time.

### Auto-Save Everything
Whenever a new feature includes any form, text input, textarea, or multi-step workflow, it MUST include draft persistence. Lauren is a mom with young children and gets interrupted constantly — work in progress must never be silently lost.

**Implementation pattern:**
- Save to `localStorage` on every `oninput` or `onchange` event
- Use a descriptive, versioned key (e.g. `featureName_draft_v1`)
- Auto-restore on page load — pre-fill fields and re-open the form/panel if a draft exists
- Show a subtle green "Your draft was restored" notice when a draft is loaded
- Clear the draft **only** on explicit success: successful server save, submit, or deliberate "Start Over" / "Cancel" click
- Expire drafts older than 24 hours
- Prefer server-side auto-save (fetch POST on change) over localStorage when a server endpoint already exists for that data; only use localStorage when there is no immediate server save
- For multi-step AI workflows (like Plan Importer), persist the full result JSON + original input so the user can return to the results phase after any interruption
